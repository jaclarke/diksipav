As you probably know, the `Internet` is an extensive network composed of countless 
interconnected networks that function seamlessly across geographical and political 
boundaries, enabling global communication and data exchange. Data flows between 
its `end-systems` (computers, smartphones, tablets, and various `IoT` devices like cars, watches, home 
appliances...) through `communication links`. These links can be made of various 
physical media, such as coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, or radio waves. 
The speed at which each link transmits data varies and is measured in `bits per second`. 
Communication links are connected by devices called packet switches. 

&nbsp;

A `packet switch` takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Two
of the most prominent types of packet switches in today's Internet are `routers` 
and `link-layer switches`. Link-layer switches are typically used in access 
networks, while routers are used in the network core. Access networks are parts 
of the network where end devices connect to the Internet.

&nbsp;

Devices must first connect to the Internet before they can send or receive data.
An `ISP (Internet Service Provider)` is a company or organization that provides 
individuals, businesses, and other entities with access to the Internet. ISPs 
enable customers to connect to the global Internet through a variety of technologies, 
such as DSL, cable, fiber optics, wireless, satelite, or mobile data networks.

If you're curious how packet switches know which outgoing link to use when 
forwarding data packets, it all comes down to addressing. Every device connected 
to the Internet is assigned a unique identifier called an `IP address` â€” much like 
how people in real life have home addresses. This IP address helps the network
ensure that data is sent to the correct destination.

&nbsp;

To ensure smooth communication between end-systems, packet switches, and other 
members of the Internet, all of them must **"speak the same language"**. This is where 
`protocols` come in. Protocols are sets of rules that control the sending and 
receiving of data across the Internet. They determine the format, timing, sequencing, 
and error-checking methods used during communication between devices, ensuring 
that the data is sent and received accurately. 

&nbsp;

There are many different protocols, and each protocol has a specific responsibility. 
They work together in a layered structure known as `protocol layering`. The 
idea is to break down the complex process of transmitting data between two devices
into smaller, manageable tasks, where each layer handles a specific function.

&nbsp;

There are two widely recognized models that describe how protocol layering works: 
the [TCP/IP](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip) model
which has four layers, and the [OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/osi-model/) 
model, which consists of seven layers. In both models, data moves from the application 
layer (where users interact with applications) down to the physical layer 
(where bits are transmitted as signals â€” whether electrical, optical or radio 
frequency). It then travels across the network to the destination device, where 
the process is reversed, moving data back up through the layers.

&nbsp;

The diagram above illustrates how data flows through protocol layers. On the 
sending side, each layer adds its own header to the package it receives from the 
layer above it. These headers are then used by the corresponding layers on the 
receiving side to interpret and process the data properly. You can also see how 
routers and link-layer switches do not implement all of the layers in the protocol 
stack. They typically implement only the bottom layers. 

&nbsp;

I'd like to acknowledge the invaluable resource [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach ](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149)
book by James Kurose and Keith Ross, which provides clear and comprehensive 
explanations of the Internet and its underlying protocols. The diagrams in this 
post are taken from this book.

&nbsp;

This will be all for now, stay tuned for the next post in this series, 
where we'll take a closer look at the `TCP/IP` model to better understand how 
data flows through its layers. ðŸš€
